# Real-Time Game Updates with WebSockets  

This project is a **real-time WebSocket-based application** that allows users to create teams and games, each involving two teams. When a game is updated, **WebSockets** ensure that all connected clients receive real-time status updates instantly. This provides a seamless and interactive experience for users without requiring manual refreshes.
